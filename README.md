## 1. What Is Card Component?

Card component is some kind of container look with rounded corners and drop shadows that you can warp around your elements.

## 2. Why You Should Use It
We use card components for keeping our code cleaner and to avoid repeating our codes.

Let's say you have multiple card-look elements and instead of repeating the same `border-radius`  , `box-shadow` etc for every single of them, you could wrap your elements around the Card component

## 3. How To Use This Reusable Component In Your Projects

You could either :

1. Clone the repository : 
```
git clone https://github.com/NazaNEYn/Card-Component-React.git
```
2. Go to src/component/card

3. Copy Card.css and Card.js and add it to your project

<br>
OR you could just go to src/component/card/Card.js and src/component/card/Card.css and just copy paste the code in your project
